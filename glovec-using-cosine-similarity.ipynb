Amy\\'s fame as the inspiration for her parents\\' Amazing Amy children\\'s books ensures widespread press coverage. The media find Nick\\'s apathy towards the disappearance suspicious. Flashbacks in the form of diary entries show a complex reality and a deterioriating marriage. Amazing Amy was an idealized completion of the real Amy\\'s failures. Both lost their jobs in the recession and moved from New York to Nick\\'s hometown of North Carthage, Missouri, to support his dying mother. Nick grew distant from Amy and began an affair with Andie, one of his students, while Amy became resentful towards Nick for uprooting her. Detective Rhonda Boney and the forensic team find poorly concealed evidence of struggle and profuse blood loss in the house. Boney learns of financial issues, spousal disputes, and Amy\\'s recent attempt to buy a gun. Medical reports indicate Amy was pregnant, which Nick denies knowledge of. On every wedding anniversary, Amy had set up elaborate treasure hunts for Nick. This year\\'s clues appear in places where Nick had sex with Andie, thus revealing Amy\\'s knowledge of his affair. Nick discovers thousands of dollars of items purchased with his credit card hidden in his twin sister Margo\\'s woodshed. Amy\\'s clues lead authorities to a half-burnt diary documenting her growing dread of Nick and ending with a genuine fear that he will kill her. The audience then learns that Amy is alive and hiding in a campground in the Ozarks. After discovering Nick\\'s affair, Amy conceived an elaborate plan to frame him for her murder. She had him ramp up her life insurance and secretly used his credit card to buy the woodshed items. She befriended a pregnant neighbor, told her stories about Nick\\'s temper, and stole her urine to fake a pregnancy thus eliciting media sympathy after her disappearance. She wrote a diary with increasingly fabricated entries, and placed incriminating evidence in the treasure hunt spots for the police to find. On the morning of her disappearance, Amy drained and splattered her own blood across the kitchen, and cleaned it haphazardly. Her original plan was to drown herself after Nick\\'s arrest, in order to ensure his death sentence. Nick deduces Amy\\'s scheme, convinces Margo of his innocence and hires lawyer Tanner Bolt, known for representing uxoricide suspects. Nick meets two of Amy\\'s ex-boyfriends: Tommy O\\'Hara claims he was framed for rape by her after he ended their relationship; wealthy Desi Collings, against whom Amy had filed a restraining order for stalking, turns Nick away. When Amy\\'s campground neighbors rob her, she calls Desi for help, convincing him that she fled Nick\\'s abuse. Desi agrees to hide her in his lakehouse. Bolt convinces Nick to reveal his affair on a popular talk show, thus seizing the narrative initiative from the media. Andie reveals the affair at a press conference shortly before the show, but Nick insists on conducting the interview. He affirms his innocence and feigns regret for his shortcomings as a spouse, knowing that Amy will be watching. The interview is a success, garnering widespread sympathy for Nick. However, Boney has already gathered enough murder evidence and arrests Nick and Margo. Bolt bails them out, and they brace for the impending trial. After watching Nick\\'s interview, Amy rekindles her attraction to him and spends weeks crafting her escape story. Using lakehouse surveillance cameras and self-inflicted wrist and vaginal injuries, she makes it appear that Desi kidnapped and raped her. She then seduces Desi, slits his throat during sex and returns home covered in his blood, thus clearing Nick of suspicion. Medical examiners lend credence to Amy\\'s story. During questioning, Boney probes her inconsistencies but Amy spins the focus onto Boney by calling her incompetent. The FBI believes Amy and closes the case, but Boney remains convinced of Amy\\'s guilt. Upon returning home, Amy tells Nick the truth, admitting to Desi\\'s murder. She states that the Nick pleading for her return on TV is the one she wants, and the one who inspired her forgiveness. Nick shares this with Boney, Bolt, and Margo. Despite unanimously agreeing that Amy is guilty, everyone acknowledges a lack of evidence. Bolt wishes Nick well and returns to New York.   A televised interview takes place in their home seven weeks later. Anticipating Nick\\'s intention to leave her and publicly expose her story, Amy reveals her pregnancy minutes before the interview, having inseminated herself with Nick\\'s sperm from a fertility clinic. Nick reacts violently at first, but feels responsible for the child and ultimately decides to stay with Amy, despite Margo\\'s despair. The \"happy\" couple announces on television that they are expecting a child.

The AI tricks the crew into firing a torpedo and then turns the torpedo back on the submarine, sinking it and killing all aboard. IMF agent Ethan Hunt is assigned to retrieve half of a cruciform key from Ilsa Faust, on whom the IMF has placed a bounty. He travels to Saudi Arabia to obtain the half-key from Ilsa. He then infiltrates a meeting of leaders of the U.S. Intelligence Community in Washington, D.C., including CIA Director Eugene Kittridge and Director of National Intelligence Denlinger, to discuss the rogue AI. Calling it the Entity, they recount how it has achieved sentience and infiltrated the major defense, military systems, intelligence, and financial networks of the world. World powers compete to obtain the key to protect their national security and control the Entity, though the exact means of controlling it are unknown. Believing the Entity poses too great a threat to humanity, Ethan seeks to destroy it.  He and his teammates Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell travel to Abu Dhabi International Airport to intercept the holder of the other half-key. Ethan evades U.S. agents as well as Gabriel, an Entity liaison with ties to Ethan's pre-IMF past, while the half-key is stolen by a professional thief named Grace. Luther identifies a suspicious piece of baggage; Benji finds what appears to be a nuclear explosive, but finds it empty after narrowly defusing it. Ethan pursues Grace to Rome. After a lengthy chase, Grace escapes again, while Ethan reunites with Benji, Luther, and Ilsa.  With Benji and Luther providing support, Ethan and Ilsa infiltrate a party held by the arms dealer, Alanna Mitsopolis, in Venice, hoping to find who hired Grace and learn of the key's purpose. Grace encounters Gabriel and learns that Alanna hired her to steal the half-key. Ethan unsuccessfully attempts to dissuade a fearful Alanna from selling it. Gabriel reveals that the Entity has infiltrated the party and determined that one of Ethan's allies, either Ilsa or Grace, will die. They all scatter afterward, with Ethan subduing but sparing Gabriel's subordinate, Paris, while Gabriel subdues Grace and kills Ilsa, devastating Ethan. A remorseful Grace joins Ethan's team, and they prepare to board the Innsbruck-bound Orient Express, where Alanna will meet with her buyer. Luther leaves for an off-grid location to investigate isolated traces of the Entity in his hard drive, warning Ethan not to kill Gabriel out of vengeance, as only Gabriel knows how to use the key. On the train, Gabriel kills the engine crew and destroys the throttle and brake. He meets Denlinger, who proposes an alliance between himself and the Entity. Denlinger explains that the complete key unlocks the chamber housing the computer of the Sevastopol, which contains the early version of the Entity that can be used to control or destroy it, once and for all. Gabriel kills Denlinger and, suspecting Paris will betray him after Ethan spared her in Venice, attempts to kill her as well. Impersonating Alanna, Grace brings the complete key to Alanna's buyer, revealed to be Kittridge. Though tempted to betray Ethan for $100 million and protection for herself, Grace decides against it, pickpockets the key from Kittridge and flees. Ethan parachutes off a cliff onto the train to save Grace from her pursuers, but Gabriel acquires the key. Ethan overpowers Gabriel atop the train, but the latter escapes and detonates a bridge ahead. Grace and Ethan detach the locomotive from the rest of the train, saving all the passengers. A revived Paris rescues them from falling off the bridge and reveals the key's connection to the Sevastopol. Ethan flees the train with the complete key, which he had pickpocketed from Gabriel during their skirmish.
